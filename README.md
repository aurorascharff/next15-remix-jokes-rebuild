# Next.js 15 "Remix Jokes" Rebuild

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is a rebuild of [Remix Jokes](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/jokes) using Next.js 15 with Server Actions, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma.

It has additional /demo routes for React Server Component and Next.js 15 functionality examples.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Getting Started

First, force install the dependencies to make the React 19 Beta work:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

Add a `.env` file to the root of the project, refer to `.env.sample` for the required environment variables.
You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

After switching, delete the `prisma/migrations` folder before running the migration command.

When using sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

When using sqllite, initialize with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```
